# 🚀 Deploying the 2048 Game with Docker & AWS! 🎮☁️

Recently, I worked on containerizing and deploying the 2048 game using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This project strengthened my skills in Docker, NGINX, and cloud deployments.

>> Tech Stack & Steps Involved:
- Used Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image
- Installed NGINX to serve the game files
- Downloaded & extracted the 2048 game from GitHub
- Configured NGINX to run in the foreground
- Exposed port 80 and containerized the app with Docker
- Deployed the containerized app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability

This project was a fantastic learning experience in Docker containerization, web server setup, and cloud deployment. Excited to explore more in DevOps & cloud automation!

Would love to connect with fellow engineers working on similar projects. 🚀
