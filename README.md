# 🚀 Deploying the 2048 Game with Docker & AWS! 🎮☁️

Recently, I worked on containerizing and deploying the 2048 game using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This project strengthened my skills in Docker, NGINX, and cloud deployments.

🔹 Tech Stack & Steps Involved:
✅ Used Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image
✅ Installed NGINX to serve the game files
✅ Downloaded & extracted the 2048 game from GitHub
✅ Configured NGINX to run in the foreground
✅ Exposed port 80 and containerized the app with Docker
✅ Deployed the containerized app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability

This project was a fantastic learning experience in Docker containerization, web server setup, and cloud deployment. Excited to explore more in DevOps & cloud automation!

Would love to connect with fellow engineers working on similar projects. 🚀
